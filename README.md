# TechCycle

This project was developed in a hackathon called "Tech Cycle".

<h2>1- About</h2>
<br>
<p>
I was in a group with 4 people, and we develop this solution to integrate multiple ways to locomote in the city.

The project starts asking to the user the origin and destination, after that, we send this data to a webservice
to calculate the best route to go from point A to B , in the fastest time.
</p>


<br><br>
<h2>2- How it works</h2>
<br>
<p>
We use the API of google maps to trace route between the two points.
